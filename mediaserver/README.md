# Livepeer Media Server (LPMS)

The Livepeer Media Server is meant to be a standalone media server
which provides:

1. Input/Output interface for video in various formats.
2. Transcoding, Transmuxing, Transrating functionality to convert
input video into various output encodings, formats, and bitrates.

At the moment, it isn't modular enough to fully decouple from the
go-livepeer packages, but this is a near term goal in the roadmap.
